Unmatched UV Ray Protection
The primary purpose of any sunscreen is to shield our skin from the damaging
UV rays of the sun. The COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Cream excels in this aspect
by providing broad-spectrum protection, effectively safeguarding your skin from
both UVA and UVB rays. This cream utilizes advanced sun protection technology,
ensuring that your skin is protected from sunburns, premature aging, and the risk
of skin cancer. By incorporating this sunscreen into your daily routine, you can

Soothing and Hydrating Properties of COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Cream

Soothing Sun Cream offers additional benefits for your skin. Enriched with the
natural goodness of aloe vera, this product boasts soothing properties that
effectively calm and nourish the skin. Aloe vera is known for its anti-inflammatory
properties, making it an excellent ingredient for sensitive and irritated skin. The
moisturizing formula of this sunscreen ensures optimal hydration, making it
suitable for all skin types, including sensitive and dry skin. Say goodbye to
parched and irritated skin, as this sun cream provides a refreshing and
revitalizing experience.
Perfect for Daily Use
Unlike some sunscreens that can feel heavy or clog pores, the COSRX Aloe
Soothing Sun Cream is specifically designed to be non-comedogenic. This
means that it won't clog your pores or cause breakouts, making it perfect for daily
use. With this product, you can seamlessly incorporate sun protection into your
skincare routine without worrying about congestion or skin irritations. This
lightweight formula allows your skin to breathe while providing the necessary
protection against the sun's harmful rays. Embrace the confidence of
well-protected and healthy skin every day.
Simple and Effective Application

To maximize the benefits of this sunscreen, it is essential to follow the proper
application steps. Start with a clean and moisturized face to ensure optimal
absorption of the product. Take a small amount of the COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun
Cream and apply it evenly onto your face and neck. Gently massage the cream
into your skin until it is fully absorbed. Allow a few minutes for the product to
settle before applying any makeup. This simple and effective application method
ensures that the sunscreen is evenly distributed and provides consistent
protection throughout the day.
It is crucial to reapply the sun cream every two hours, especially if you're
exposed to direct sunlight for an extended period. This ensures continuous
protection and allows you to enjoy the outdoors without compromising your skin's
health. By following these application guidelines, you can make the most of the
COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Cream and ensure maximum sun protection.
